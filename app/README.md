## Documentation for Flask Application

This document provides an overview of the Flask application located in the `app` directory.

**Directory Structure:**

```

│    ├── mongodb.py (Module for MongoDB storage)
│    ├── rabbitmq.py (Module for RabbitMQ storage)
│    ├── redis.py (Module for Redis storage)
│    └── s3.py (Module for Amazon S3 storage)
```

**Stores:**

The `stores` directory contains modules implementing different storage backends for the application. You can choose and configure one or more storage options based on your needs.

- `database.py`: Provides functionality for storing data in a database (implementation details depend on the chosen database technology).
- `file.py` (optional): Offers a simple file-based storage solution (suitable for small datasets or testing).
- `memcached.py` (optional): Enables storing data in a high-performance in-memory key-value store (Memcached).
- `mongodb.py` (optional): Provides integration with a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for flexible data storage.
- `rabbitmq.py` (optional): Implements data storage using a message queue (RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication.
- `redis.py`: Offers storage using the popular in-memory data store Redis.
- `s3.py` (optional): Enables storing data in a cloud storage service like Amazon S3.

**Configuration:**

The `settings.py` file holds configuration details for the application, including:

- Store selection (default and supported options)
- Database connection details (if using a database store)
- Redis connection details (if using Redis)
- File path for file-based storage (optional)
- Other application-specific configuration settings

**Core Application Logic:**

The `core` directory contains the heart of the application logic:

- `app.py`: This is the main Flask application file responsible for routing, configuration, and potentially initializing the chosen store.
- `config`: This directory holds configuration-related files, including helper functions for working with configuration settings.
- `urls.py`: This file defines the URL routing rules for the application, mapping URLs to specific functions or views.

**API Endpoints (Optional):**

The `apis` directory is currently empty but could be used to house API endpoints for your application. Each file within `apis` might represent a specific API endpoint with its own logic.

**Running the Application:**

You can typically run the application using `python main.py`. This will start the Flask development server, allowing you to access the application in your web browser (usually at http://127.0.0.1:5000 by default).

**Further Considerations:**

- Refer to the individual store module documentation (within `stores`) for details on specific storage backends and their configuration options.
- The `settings.py` file should be customized with your chosen configuration values.
- Consider implementing environment variables for sensitive configuration details.

This documentation provides a high-level overview of the application structure and functionalities. Consult the source code for specific implementation details and customization options.
